If you enjoy any of my work and want to help me to continue to create and share and you can afford it, then there are a few options for supporting it.

Take out a paid subscription to Rusty Niall. Rusty Niall is my weekly(ish) newsletter, currently hosted on Buttondown. Subscribers get my essays delivered to their inboxes while paid subscribers also get an occasional curated post of my creative writing with some additional commentary and free access to my upcoming digital pamphlets/audiobooks on itch.io. I don't currently use Patreon so this option is the best way to help me keep my lights on. Monthly subs are £5 a month and annual subs are £50.

Buy me a coffee. I don't have a patreon but I have a kofi so there's always the option of a one-off payment if you feel so inclined. Treat it as if you just bumped into me and felt like shouting me a pint or a cup of coffee.

Buy my books from Flipped Eye. My New and Selected, Werewolf of London, was released in 2021 and it's the best way to get acquainted with the poems I wrote during the first quarter century of my career. It draws a neat boundary line between how I used to work with performance and traditional publishing and how I work in a mainly digital (and anti-social) sense these days. Not only is this the best ways to get me a good deal on my royalties (and keeping your money out of Amazon's coffers) but  it also helps a truly brilliant publisher that has managed to weather the storms in publishing for a couple of turbulent decades.

Buy my digital pamphlets/audiobooks from itch.io . There's not much there at the moment but I am planning on releasing little digital bundles consisting of ebooks (epub, PDF and plain text) and audiobooks too. Paid subscribers to Rusty Niall will receive free download links via email when they release.
