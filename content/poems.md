I have been writing and sharing poems since I was a nipper. If you're interested in what I wrote during the first twenty-ish years of my career, then I'd recommend my New and Selected poems, Werewolf of London (Flipped Eye, 2021)

Nowadays I post more poems online and no longer perform regularly. I have decided to post them all here as I write them but will also produce the odd combined digital pamphlet/audiobook which will be available on my itch.io page for purchase (and also given to my paid Rusty Niall subscribers).

You might notice that each poem has a status: seed, sapling, shrub or tree. This refers to how finished I consider the poem to be as well as which ones I think are my most accomplished. The rubric runs like this:

* **seed**: not even a first draft, more a fragment or a rough sketch that might go on to become something bigger or more finished
* **sapling**: an early draft, not something I consider finished but relatively complete within itself
* **shrub**: a finished poem. Not necessarily one that I consider to be a cornerstone or benchmark, but complete and finished as far as I regard it.
* **tree**: not only a finished poem but one I feel a bit smug about. It might also be something that marks a previous watershed if it's an older one. 

For now the poems will just appear as a list but when they get numerous enough I'll probably find another way of organising them. I recommend just finding something that interests you and then following the links that are available from there.
