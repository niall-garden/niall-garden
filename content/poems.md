I have been writing and sharing poems since I was a nipper. If you're interested in what I wrote during the first twenty-ish years of my career, then I'd recommend my New and Selected poems, Werewolf of London (Flipped Eye, 2021)

Nowadays I post more poems online and no longer perform regularly. I have decided to post them all here as I write them but will also produce the odd combined digital pamphlet/audiobook which will be available on my itch.io page for purchase (and also given to my paid Rusty Niall subscribers).

For now the poems will just appear as a list but when they get numerous enough I'll probably find a way of sorting them out from each other. I recommend just finding something that interests you and then following the links that are available from there.
