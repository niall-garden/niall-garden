While I intend to make niall.garden my main web presence from now on, you can also find me at the following platforms and websites:

[My website: niallosullivan.co.uk](https://niallosullivan.co.uk)

My original home online. It's been through a few transformations over the years but for now it's my main placeholder on the web, giving information and links to all of my other projects.

[My essays/newlstetter: Rusty Niall](https://buttondown.email/niall/)  

Home of my (usually) weekly essays and other writings. You can sign up to have them send straight to your inbox when they're ready. If you enjoy my work and would like to support it, then you can sign up for a paid membership for a monthly/annual subscription of £5/£50. 

[My youtube channel](https://youtube.com/niallosullivan)

This channel has been subject to fits of activity and seasons of neglect for many years. I have recently posted a number of video essay/lectures that I feel pretty proud of. I don't think Mr Beast has anything to worry about for the time being.

[Threads](https://threads.net/@rusty_niall)

I'm a little cynical about this one, but it does seem to be the place that most are heading to in the wake of the slow death of the bird site. So I maintain a presence but try my best to hop in and out when I use it so I don't get sucked into the vortex of a slightly less doom-ridden scroll.

[Mastodon](https://sunny.garden/@rustyniall)

Mastodon and the rest of the fediverse is our last hope for an open, independent internet. Lots of different accounts across different services that can see and respond to each other. I love Mastodon because it feels like a series of rabbit holes rather than one constant downwards churn of content. Mastodon doesn't make much sense until you find the stuff you love and fill your feed with joy and whimsy. I love it there even though it is my least clouty plaform.
