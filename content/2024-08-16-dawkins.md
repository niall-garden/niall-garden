 I was quite the Dawkins fanboy for a while. I genuinely loved his books about evolution, at his best he matched Attenborough documentaries for the sense of wonder he expressed about nature. Then, around the early 2010s, the New Atheist movement he was associated with split into a reactionary right wing faction and a more progressive faction. 

I ended up taking all of my copies of his books to Oxfam around the time of his wretched "Dear Muslima" response to Rebecca Watson talking about being sexually harrassed at an atheist conference. He just seems to have carried on in the same vein ever since. 

Back in the day, atheists would say that atheism is as much a belief as not playing chess is a hobby. I seem to have taken that to heart these days as I don't define or lable myself by way of the things I don't believe in. I still find nature to be magical. I quite like religion these days too, even though I doubt I'll ever belong to one (though Buddhism keeps making eyes at me).
