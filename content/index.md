Hello! My name is Niall O'Sullivan and I am a poet, lecturer, event host, essayist, youtuber, husband and dad.

This is my digital garden, a place for my poems, thoughts, notes, essays and maybe some art too. 

This site has been built from an Obsidian vault via the Quartz tool and published via github pages.

Being a digital garden, my visitors are free to wander, following links from post to post and finding their own way around. It'll probably be a bit sparse in the beginning with a few green shoots and saplings but I hope it'll become wild and unmanageable soon.
