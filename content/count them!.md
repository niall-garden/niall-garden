on the concrete perimeters  
edging the grass verges  
on the denmark hill estate  
I count at least fifty snails

coaxed out by nightlong rain  
from green bristly blades  
onto the slick surfaces of a world  
that was made just for them

how many beaks bikes or boot heels  
will crack through their casings?  
what wild stupid strokes of luck  
will ferry the few to lush leaves?

I would have filmed them all  
if I hadn't left my phone back home –⁠  
it's just me the snails and the rain  
and my thoughts –⁠ oh yes –⁠ here they come
