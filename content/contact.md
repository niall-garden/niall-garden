If you would like to get in touch you can email me at the address below (remove the spaces and replace "at" and "dot" with their respective punctuation marks):

rusty niall at icloud dot com

You can also contact me via the some of the socials mentioned in my links page.

I may not get back to you, please don't see it as something personal if that is the case. I can get easily overwhelmed sometimes and put a lot of things on the back burner. That said, there are two things to be particularly aware of:

1. If you are enquiring about a work opportunity, please state in your email whether it is a paid opportunity and, if you can, give some indication of the work and money involved.
2. Please don't ask me for my postal address. If you want me to read something of yours then please send or point me towards a readable pdf or digital version. Even then, I might be too busy to read your work or give feedback.

The two reasons given above are the most likely cause of me not replying to an email, mainly because I find it awkward having to bring up the subject of payment myself or explaining why I don't feel comfortable giving you my home address. 

This doesn't mean that I think ill of you or too much of myself, I just  tend to avoid potentially awkward sitiuations these days. Thank you for your understanding.

Niall
